                    <p>You've probably thought about martial arts before.</p>
                    <p>But here's what usually stops families cold: walking into a room full of experienced students
                        who've been training for years.</p>
                    <p>Your kid feels awkward. You feel out of place. Everyone seems to know what they're doing except
                        you.</p>
                    That's exactly why I created something different.

                        <p>I've been teaching for over 30 years, and I've seen thousands of people transform their lives
                            through martial arts.</p>
                        <p>But I've also seen too many people miss out because they were too intimidated to start.</p>
                        <p>That's why I created these special beginner-only classes — designed so even families can give
                            it a try together.</p>

                <p>I can only accommodate a limited number of students — especially since these are beginner-only
                    groups.</p>
                <p>That's what keeps the environment safe, comfortable, and welcoming for everyone — including shy teens
                    and nervous parents.</p>
                <p>Once this group fills up, the next opportunity won't be for several weeks.</p>
                <p>And the longer you wait, the easier it becomes to go back to the couch, the screen, the excuse.</p>
                <p class="lead" style="color: var(--color-crimson);">New Year. New opportunity. Try something new. >>>
