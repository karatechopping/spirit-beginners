                    <p>If walking into a martial arts school feels intimidating… I get it. My first class was 37 years
                        ago and I
                        still remember it as clear as day.!</p>
                    <p>I understand how intimidating it can be to try martial arts, even if it's something you have
                        wanted to do for a long time.</p>
                    <p>That's why I am running some free beginners classes in January 2026</p>

                <p>You've probably thought about it before. Maybe you were walking to your car late at night and wished
                    you felt more confident about protecting yourself.</p>
                <p>Or you saw someone practicing martial arts and thought, "I'd love to try that... but where would I
                    even start?"</p>
                <p>Here's what I know, and I've been teaching Taekwon-Do for over two decades.</p>
                <p class="highlight">Most people who want to learn martial arts never actually start.</p>

                        <p>My name is Brett Kraiger, and I'm a 6th Dan Black Belt in Taekwon-Do.</p>
                        <p>I've been teaching for over 30 years, and I've seen thousands of people transform their lives
                            through martial arts.</p>
                        <p>But I've also seen too many people miss out because they were too intimidated to start.</p>
                        <p>That's why I created these special beginner-only classes — designed so even families can give
                            it a try together.</p>
